1. python is open source language
2. python is interpreter language
2.1 python is called interpreterr language because it does not compile
2.2 does not compile means it does not create pre memory
2.3 does not create pre memory means memory will be created on run time
3.4 create a memory on run time is called dynamic memory allocation
2.5 anything that is dynamically alloted is what we called as scripting language
2.6 scripting language can also be interpreter language

3. memory management in python is carried out by python virtual memory
3.1 python virtual memory is called as PRIVATE HEAP

4. PYTHON IS called as unstructured python programming language
4.1 unstructred programming language means writting the code without any template to be followed.

5. python is automated garbage collection
5.1 automated garbage collection means variable that is not in use will be removed from the memory

6. python is case sensitive

7. python is indent specific

8. python is sequential program execution
8.1 means it will read character by character or line by line
8.2 this line by line execution is happening because of the concept of GIL
8.3 GIL means global interpreted lock
8.4 means when one line get executued next line will be locked
8.5 because of this mechanism python will be slower in execution when compare to other language
